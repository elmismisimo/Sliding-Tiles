# Sliding-Tiles
Classic Sliding Tiles Puzzle Game

This is another game of a series I call Black and White (Casual minimalistic games), and is anoother of those 24 hour games, and actually did it in less time. Thats because I used the same interface as 2048 and Mine Sweeper and updated the game rules, and it was actually finished bellow 6 hours.

But didnt published the game right away. Actually implementing all the achievements and leaderboards from google play takes ages, because everything has to be done manually. And in the proccess of doing this, I detected a very good upgrade for the usability, that I implemented.

Another issue I found is that I cannot generate the board randomly, I have to generate the board in the correct order and Randomly scramble it. Because when its just generated randomly, there is a chance that the board is unsolvable, because it was generated in the incorrect order, and not a scrambled correct order.

Any way, the game is out and published, you can find it at

or download the apk in the SlidingTiles/app folder

Enjoy!
